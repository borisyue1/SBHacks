# Snappit 
Snappit is a web application that retrieves text from an uploaded picture using Tesseract's OCR and 
displays search results for it using the Bing web search API. Students can use this application to easily search 
for potential solutions to worksheet/exam problems that they are stuck on. Users can save webpages that they like, which 
get stored in the database.
